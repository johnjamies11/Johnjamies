# Hi, I'm [john james] 👋

I’m an engineer exploring **AI alignment, fairness, and robustness** in large language models.  
My research interests focus on understanding how fine-tuning can:
- Improve **alignment** with human values
- Reduce **biases** and improve **fair representation** across groups
- Strengthen **robustness** against adversarial or noisy prompts

## 🔬 Current Research
- Evaluating fairness and demographic representation in LLM outputs
- Testing robustness under distributional shifts and adversarial queries
- Exploring fine-tuning strategies for more equitable outcomes

*"Engineering better AI systems means building models that are not only powerful, but also fair, safe, and aligned with human values."*
